# About This Guide

Welcome! If you're here, then you're probably taking AP Physics Electricity and Magnetism, or maybe you just like the subject. Whatever the case, this site is here to help you!

We are two high school students who have made this guide to help others who need it. It features instructional content, quizzes, videos, and a compilation of other resources that we ourselves found useful. With this site, we hope to spread that knowledge to everyone and we hope you find this useful too!

Without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Using This Site

Use the navigation pane on the left hand side to go through the physics topics. They are separated by their corresponding unit and sub-unit.

Note: the first unit does not start at one since E&M is actually the second half of the AP Physics course. Units 1 through 7 are AP Mechanics. If you're looking for resources on that, we suggest [crashwhite.com](https://www.crashwhite.com/apphysics/faqs.html).

## Suggest a Change

We make mistakes too! If something is incorrect or you simply want to suggest content to add, contact us at  **email goes here**.
