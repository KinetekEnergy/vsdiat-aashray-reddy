# About This Guide

Welcome! If you're here, then you probably know what VSDIAT is.

* [VSDIAT website](https://vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com/)
* [VSDIAT GitHub](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/)

This site is for all my notes about what I learned. Is a website overkill? Yes. Does it look good though? Yes.

## "I can't see an image" / "This image is too small!"

You can click on any image in the website and it will present a zoomed-in view, allowing you to see it better.

## Where are you getting your images from?

Some images may come from the VSDIAT course. Images with chip diagrams or pictures (not Magic or anything from the VM) are from the course. These images are extremely well-made, and I used them because I don't think I can make a better diagram.

Images of Magic or the terminal are from my VM. Some terminal commands and inputs may be formatted as a *code block* instead of a screenshot. This improves readability and makes it easier if you want to copy and paste the text. Also, it's much easier for me to write a code block than take several screenshots. Lastly, using code blocks more often than screenshots can improve the website loading time and reduce overhead because there are less assets to load.
