# About This Guide

Welcome! If you're here, then you probably know what VSDIAT is.

* [VSDIAT website](https://vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com/)
* [VSDIAT GitHub](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/)

This site is for all my notes about what I learned. Is a website overkill? Yes. Does it look good though? Yes.

## "I can't see an image" / "This image is too small!"

You can click on any image in the website and it will present a zoomed-in view, allowing you to see it better.
