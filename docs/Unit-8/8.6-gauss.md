# 8.6 - Gauss's Law

## 8.6.1 - Electric Flux

Earlier we learned about electric fields and their interactions with objects. However, we have not yet covered the idea of an electric field passing through a surface. By definition, the meaning of flux is flow. A measurement of flux is a measurement of flow. To better understand the idea of electric flux, we must understand flux itself first. 

Before tackling electric flux, let's assume we are working with air. Let's assume that air is traveling through a vent of area $A = 4 \, \text{m}^2$ at a velocity of $v = 10 \, \text{m/s}$. How can we calculate the flux in this scenario? Well, flux is nothing but flow so in reality we are trying to calculate the rate for the amount fo air which is flowing out of this vent. So we are trying to calculate the amount of air which flows out of this vent every second.

(TODO: Model of air flowing out of vent, create a cube of air going through the vent)

From this we realize that every second, the air which flows out stretches 10 meters. The area of the vent is 4 meters squared though. So to give our answer for the electric flux, we are able to just multipy the velocity by the area to get an electric flux of 40 cubic meters per second. From this, we can get the equation $\Phi_A = VA_{\perp}$ which explains that the flux of the air is equal to the velocity it flows at times the area of the outlet. It is also important to note that A is the area which is perpendicular to the electric field vector. 

Now in order to think of this in the context of electric flux, we must replace velocity with the electric field vector. Electric flux is a measure of the flow of an electric field through a surface. Therefore, the formula for electric flux becomes $\Phi_E = EA_{\perp}$. If the electric field vector enters a surface from a diirection which is not perpendicular though, the component of the area which is perpendicular to the electric field vector is used instead. So the equation could also be written as $\Phi_E = EAcos(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the electric field line and an imaginary line which is perpendicular to the area.

$\Phi_E = EA_{\perp} = EAcos(\theta)$

**Note:** $\theta$ is the angle between the electric field line and an imaginary line which is perpendicular to the area

:::info[Sample Question]

A large flat metal sheet lies horizontally on the ground under a uniformly distributed electric field. A circular loop of radius $r = 0.4 , \text{m}$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, which point vertically upward with a constant magnitude of $E = 250 , \text{N/C}$. What is the total electric flux $\Phi_E$ through the loop?

$\Phi_E = EA\cos\theta$

Since the electric field is perpendicular to the loop, $\theta = 0^\circ$, and $\cos\theta = 1$

$A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.4)^2 = 0.16\pi , \text{m}^2$

$\Phi_E = (250)(0.16\pi) = 40\pi , \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

$\Phi_E \approx 125.7 , \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

What if we are now working with complex surfaces? Like maybe a closed surface? The area of that will not only be too complex to find, but the electric flux will differ at each part of the figure due to the differing orientations of the perpendicular surface and the electric field vector.

(TODO: Picture here)

Well, in physics we usually see that whenever there is a problem concerning multiple infinitely small pieces, especially in an equation, the answer almost always requires calculus. Imagine if we separated this complex figure into multiple squares. In a closed surface such as the surface of the sphere we are analyzing the flux of the electric field vector entering and exiting. So if the field lines go outwards, the electric flux is positive. If the field lines go inwards, the electric flux is negative. A flux of 0 means that the electric field vector is parallel to the surface itself.


:::tip[Key Equation]

$\Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$

**Note:** The integral with a ring in it represents a surface integral. Evaluating it requires knowledge of the complex plane. You do NOT need to know solve these types of integrals in this course. Usually this integral will simplify into something which is easier to work with.

:::danger[Warning]

The surface integral is not to be confused with a contour integral. The distinction requires knowledge of multivariable calculus which is fundamental to electricity and magnetism, but simplified for the AP Physics E&M course.
