# 8.4 - Electric Field Lines

## 8.4.1 - Overview of Electric Field Lines

Earlier we talked about electric fields as a vector quantity represented by the symbol $\mathbf{E}$. Our entire understanding of electric fields stems from the interactions of positively and negatively charged objects and the test charge $\mathbf{P}$ which by scientific convention is always assumed positive. It is based on this assumption that we found out that for a positive test charge P, the direction of $\mathbf{E}$ will face away from a positively charged object, but toward a negatively charged one. The magnitude of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ will get larger with a closer radius $\mathbf{r}$ as shown by $\mathbf{E} \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$

There are models which show this concept in action in the previous module, but they were also sketched out in a linear 1 dimensional sense. Michael Faraday developed a useful method for us to futher visualize these electric fields. electric field lines are a way for us to look at electric fields in a simple manner while taking into characteristics provided by electric fields into account.

:::tip[Key Concepts]

In an electric field line diagram:
- Positively charged objects have the electric field lines radiate outward
- Negatively charged objects have the electric field lines raddiate inward
- The lines get denser near the charged objects
- Dense electric field lines symbolize a stronger field
- The electric field vector $\mathbf{E}$ is always tangent to a field line at any point

:::danger[Warning]

Electric field lines are NOT REAL. A common misconception is that they are. This is not very true because in electric field line models, there are only a finite amount of lines which model the actions of the electric field. In reality, an electric fieldd is a continuous vector so the field exists at every point in space around the charge

(TODO: sketch of positive and negative electric field lines)

As you can see, the idea of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ facing away from a positively charged object, but toward a negatively charged one is still at play here. Below is a diagram of what an electric field line diagram may look like for both a positively and negatively charged particle.

## 8.4.2 - Analysis of Electric Fields in Dipoles

Again, the linear density of an electric field is proportional to its charge magnitude, an idea represented by $\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{C} q$ such that $\mathbf{N}$ is the number of lines, $\mathbf{q}$ is the charge, and $\mathbf{C}$ is a constant. We can also model the interactions between two charged objects through an electric field when modeling a dipole. A dipole is a system of two charged objects.

:::tip[Key Concepts]

When drawing a diagram for a dipole:
- The electric field lines always go from positive to negative
- Lines deflect if charged objects repel
- Lines converge if charged objects attract
- If both objects have unequal charges, only some amount of the lines reach the negative charge. The rest are deflected

Below are different models of dipoles followed by their respective charge magnitudes and signs.
