# 8.1 - Introduction to Electrical Charges

## 8.1.1 - Electrical Charge

### History

In the mid 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted a series of experiments concerning the attraction between objects and their electrical properties. He would work with materials such as glass rods, silk, and metal while analyzing their behavior when rubbed against one another. The idea that opposite charges attract and like charges repel was already observed by many, but he tried to uncover the inner workings behind this concept. His idea of `positive charges` and `negative charges` went on to become a strong foundation for the field of electromagnetism.

### Foundational Concepts

When materials adhere in the way that silk andd glass adhere after rubbing, they are said to be `electrified` or electrically charged.

The foundational concepts for electrical charges are as follows:

- Negative charges are posessed by electrons
- Positive charges are posessed by protons
- Like charges repel, opposite charges attract
- Electrical charge is ALWAYS conserved
- Electrical charges are quantized

### Negative and Positive Charges

As you may recall, an atom is made up of `electrons (-)`, `protons (+)`, and `neutrons (0)`. Depending on the combinations of electrons, protons and neutrons, the atom is then either positively or negatively charged.

Positively charged objects are at a loss of electrons. Their net charge is positive because there are fewer electrons then there are protons.

Negatively charged objects are at a gain of extra electrons. Their charge is negative because there are fewer protons then there are electrons


### Convervation of Electrical Charge

Electrical charge is never actually created. It is conserved through a transfer of electrons between charged objects. This transfer creates attraction.

It is also impportant to note that `electrons move, but protons stay put` so the attraction between two oppositely charged objects occurs because `the negatively charged object's electrons attact to the net positive charge of the positively charged object`

### Quantization of Electrons

In 1909, Rober Milikan performed the `oil drop experiment`. In this experiment, he carefully measured the electrical charge on tiny oil droplets suspended in an electric fieldd. He found that electricity is actually `quantized` meaning it comes out in `chunks` or `discrete packets`. 

Foundationally, this became the formula `q = Ne` such that `q` is the total charge, `N` is an integer number, positive or negative, and `e` is the elementary charge.

The idea became that:
- Electrons have a charge of `-e`, but negatively charged objects can have charges like `-2e` and `-3e`
- Protons have a charge of `+e`, but positively charged objects can have charges like `+2e` and `+3e`
- Neutrons have a charge of `0`

## 8.1.2 Charging Objects by Induction

### Conductors and Insulators

Conductors `e.g. Metals` are materials in which some electrons are free. Meaning electrons can move freely throughout the materials.

Insulators `e.g. Glass` are materials in which all electrons are bound to atoms and can't move freely at all. 

Semiconductors `e.g. Silicon` have properties similar to both conductors and insulators.

### Charging Objects by Induction

Induction is the process of charging a conductor, such as a metal, without touching it. Below is an example of how this works

1. A piece of metal starts with neutral charge (equal electrons and protons)
2. The metal is brought near a negatively charged rod
3. Since the rod is negatively charged, it repels at first with the sphere
4. The part sphere closest to the rod will now have a positive charge
5. Ground the wire attached to the sphere so that the electrons which are repelled by the rod escape into the ground
6. Remove the ground connection and the rod
7. The sphere is not positively charged because the repelled electrons escaped into the ground
