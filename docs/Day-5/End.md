# Done

Whew! You made it!

Congratulations — your chip is now ready to be sent off for fabrication! 📦

All the hard work has paid off. The GDSII file is packed, polished, and primed for silicon. If everything went well, your chip will *hopefully* behave just as you designed it.

If not... well, that's what revisions are for. 😅

Welcome to the glamorous world of hardware — where "it compiles" isn't good enough, and Murphy's Law is just another design constraint.

Happy taping out! ❤️
